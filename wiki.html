			<h3 class="fblue">Gameplay</h3>
			<p>No Click's Sky is a <span class="fblue">multipayer idling browser RPG</span></p>
			<p>In No Click's Sky, you mine ores, which drop gems. You can later spend these gems to upgrade your weapons, buy bonuses, and craft powerful boosts. Every planet in the game offers a new set of upgrades for your gun, and a new ore which you can mine.</p>
			<p>You can also join a Unity, where you can team up with other people to mine difficult gems, or even stars and black holes. This is called the <span class="fblue">Unity Raid</span>. Completing a raid rewards players with lots gems, and unique loot from different raids.</p>
			<p>For some, the goal to completing an idling game is by unlocking all achievements. But, you can also set some goals yourself.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="wikibox" id="section1">
			<h3 class="fblue">Upgrades</h3>
			<p>Upgrading your weapon increases your Damage</p>
			<p>You get a new set of upgrades whenever you ascend to a different planet. To buy these new upgrades, you will need to mine the new material from the planet you just ascended to.</p>
			<p>You keep the damage from your previous set of upgrades, but you will have to go back to a corresponding upgrades planet to buy them.</p>
			<p>When you upgrade your weapon to a certain level, you are rewarded with unique <span style="color: #5bc0de;">bonuses</span></p>
		</div>
		<div class="wikibox" id="section2">
			<h3 class="fblue">Bonuses</h3>
			<p>There are four main groups of bonuses</p>
			<p><span class="fgreen">Common</span> @Lv. 25</p>
			<p><span class="fblue">Rare</span> @Lv. 100</p>
			<p><span class="fpurple">Epic</span> @Lv. 200</p>
			<p><span class="forange">Legendary</span> @Lv 350</p><br>
			<p>Every bonus in the game powers you up with unique bonus. Strenght of the bonus depends on the group of upgrade</p>
			<p>Upgrade also has it's damage multiplied every 25 levels. This upgrade is free. At level 500, it's damage gets multiplied by 10.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="wikibox" id="section3">
			<h3 class="fblue">Runes</h3>
			<p>You can craft Runes with Dark Matter. Putting a rune in a certain socket permanently boosts your stats</p>
			<p><span class="fred">Idling Rune</span> - Reduces Idle Tick rate by 10ms</p>
			<p><span class="fblue">Clicking Rune</span> - Increases damage by 0.01% for every click</p>
			<p><span class="fgreen">Mythical Runes</span> - Increases stats relevant to both play styles</p>
			<p>Keeping your Dark Matter is always a good idea, as each increases your damage by 1%. You can also dump some into buying runes</p>
			<p>Buying runes in the early game isn't a good choice. However, these runes are fundamental for the late game, as their bonuses will help you progress further, for a small price</p>
		</div>
		<div class="wikibox" id="section4">
			<h3 class="fblue">Achievements</h3>
			<p>There are four main groups of achievements</p>
			<p><span class="fgreen">Common</span> - Easy, but they grant no bonus.
			<p><span class="fblue">Rare</span> - Medium, increases Damage by 1% for every rare achievement obtained.</p>
			<p><span class="fpurple">Epic</span> - Hard, you are rewarded with a rune for every epic achievement obtained.</p>
			<p><span class="forange">Legendary</span> - Extreme, each doubles your damage</p><br>
			<p>Achievements indicate a completed milestone. Unlocking them also displays a cool badge under your profile.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="wikibox" id="section5">
			<h3 class="fblue">Ascencion</h3>
			<p>Don't worry. You wont be stuck mining plutonium for the rest of your days.</p>
			<p>Upgrading your weapon further would seem impossible, but you get to ascend to a different planet. Ascending to a different planet unlocks new weapon. You keep your stats, just mine a different ore, to upgrade the new weapon</p>
			<p>When you pick up on damage you can go back to a previous planet to easily mine the resource there and get important bonuses from that planets upgrades</p>
			<p>Do this untill you hit a brick wall. Now it's time to create a miniverse. This means that you go into a universe wihtin a universe</p>
			<p>In this next universe, all your stats are reset, and you CAN'T go back to a previous universe. But you gain permanent damage increase based on your highest zone in the previous universe</p>
